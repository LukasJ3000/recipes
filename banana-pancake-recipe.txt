Banana-Pancakes

You'll need:

-----------------

400g flower
50g sugar
300ml milk
3 eggs
1 banana
some time
money

------------------

1. Mix flower, sugar and milk. 
2. Realize that it doesn't work because you are using too much flower.
3. Throw away eggs.
4. Eat banana.
5. Order pancakes because you are bad at cooking (just like me).
